# Animal Personality Quiz

This project is a personality quiz that helps users discover which animal they are most like based on their answers to a series of personality questions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the personality quiz, including a form with various personality questions and a section to display the results.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the quiz, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the HTML elements.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for the quiz. It handles form submission, processes the answers, calculates the result based on the user's responses, and displays the corresponding animal result.
- **data/questions.csv**: Contains the questions for the personality quiz in CSV format. Each row represents a question, and it may include options for answers.
- **data/results.csv**: Contains the results for the quiz in CSV format. Each row represents an animal type and the criteria that lead to that result based on the user's answers.
